# AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry PHP

This repository contains documentation and sample apps for the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry in PHP library. It provides the AWS service integrations for traces for the OpenTelemetry PHP library. The library can be configured to support trace applications with the AWS X-Ray service. 

This enables all the features of the OpenTelemetry project and configures its components to create traces that can be viewed in the AWS X-Ray console and allow propagation of those contexts across multiple downstream AWS services.
